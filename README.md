# EEMTL-GRU

This repository contains the implementation of the **EEMTL-GRU** model and other comparative models used in our experiments for multi-task learning on time series data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores a GRU-based architecture enhanced with multi-task learning strategies to improve classification performance. The experiments include comparisons against various baseline models and different configurations of our proposed architecture.
